<p class="paragraphlad">My name is Zakary Henson. I am a Sophomore at Madison Academic High School. I've always enjoyed making videos, but never got serious about it until freshman year. Since then, I've made numerous short videos for fun and for various organizations. Some of my most notable works include Scooters, one of my first and longest videos, a clip for a veteran's day program, and numerous slideshows and school projects. I am also vice president of our school's film club. Along with that, I competed in the state speech and debate tournament and placed 7th in duo interpertation. Here you can see some of my project's ive worked on along with my scouting adventures.</p>
